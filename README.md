## My process

I started my process by dividing the layout into divs and started coding by writing HTML code and after completing HTML, I started with CSS from top to bottom flow and I used Grid layout for the 3 column design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about CSS grid layout and responsiveness using media queries.
